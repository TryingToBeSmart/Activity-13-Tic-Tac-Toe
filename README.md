# Activity 13 Tic Tac Toe

Form app that uses a 2d array to keep track of the gameboard on the back end.  Changes images as players click on the gameboard.

I learned how to assing images to a Bitmap so that they can be assigned and compared when boxes are clicked and when the new game button is clicked.  I also learned how to add images to the Resources so that they can be assigned to picture boxes easier.
If I had more time, I would add a more satisfying winner image.
I had a difficult time understanding the difference between assigning the picture box image vs background image.  Assigning the image seems easier, but the background image has more options like Zoom to make it look centered inside the picture box.
